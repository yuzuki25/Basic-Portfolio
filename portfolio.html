        <p>Hello there! Thank you for checking out my portfolio website! Who am I, you ask? My name is Yuzuki Needham and I'm currently enrolled in Universtiy of Denver's coding bootcamp program. I've graduated two years ago from University of Colorado Denver with a bachelor of arts in Psychology, but I did not think I wanted to continue with further education in that particular field. So while I tried to figure out what I wanted to do with myself, I've been working as a pizza chef. However, the food industry is stressful, so I came to find out through multiple experiences, I decided I wanted to gain a skill that would help me work for myself or gain a better job. I've had many thoughts on different kinds of programs, but I decided to go with learning to code because the tech industry is where jobs will be from now to the future, but also because my friend and I were interested in starting our own business and having the skill to code programs will be useful for us in that case. I am just getting started with this taxing task of learning to code and have a lot to learn, but I am confident that I will learn and make this skill mine. I do not know what my future holds, but I hope to make this experience worth while!</p>
