                <p>Hello there! Thank you for checking out my portfolio website! Who am I, you ask? My name is Yuzuki
                    Needham and I'm currently enrolled in Universtiy of Denver's coding bootcamp program. I've graduated
                    two years ago from University of Colorado Denver with a bachelor of arts in Psychology, but I did
                    not think I wanted to continue with further education in this particular field. </p>
                
                <p>
                    While I tried to
                    figure out what I wanted to do with myself, I've been working as a pizza chef. However, the food
                    industry is stressful, so I came to find out through multiple experiences, I decided I wanted to
                    gain a skill that would help me work for myself or gain a better job. I've had many thoughts on
                    different kinds of programs, but I decided to go with learning to code because the tech industry is
                    where jobs will be from now to the future, but also because my friend and I were interested in
                    starting our own business and having the skill to code programs will be useful for us in that case. </p>
                    
                <p>    
                    I am just getting started with this taxing task of learning to code and have a lot to learn, but I
                    am confident that I will learn and make this skill mine. I do not know what my future holds, but I
                    hope to make this experience worth while!</p>
